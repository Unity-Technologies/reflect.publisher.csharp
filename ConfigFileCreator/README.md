# ConfigFileCreator
This is a small utilitary project that helps generate a config file, which can be used to skip the Reflect UI (for example in automated publishing).

For more information about the Reflect API, see the README file at the root of the repository.

## Command line parameters
The command takes a single parameter, which is the path to the file you wish to create.
